# Generative AI Chatbot Project

## Overview
This repository contains code for the Generative AI Nanodegree project titled "Build Your Own Custom Chatbot" submitted by Vanessa Trujillo on 3/21/24. The project focuses on developing a custom chatbot using Generative AI techniques.

## Custom Chatbot Project
The custom chatbot is designed to provide engaging and informative responses across a wide range of topics. Leveraging Wikipedia as a data source, the chatbot can dynamically generate responses based on user queries, making it akin to having a virtual encyclopedia at your disposal.

## Data Wrangling
The chosen dataset for this project is Wikipedia, which offers a vast repository of information on various topics. The data is processed and organized into a pandas dataframe, allowing for efficient handling and analysis.

## Dependencies
The code utilizes various Python libraries and dependencies, including requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, OpenAI, and others. The requirements.txt file lists all required dependencies for easy installation.

## Custom Query Completion
The project includes code for composing custom queries using the chosen dataset and retrieving results from an OpenAI Completion model. The completion model is trained to generate responses tailored to user queries, enhancing the chatbot's conversational capabilities.

## Custom Performance Demonstration
The performance of the custom query system is demonstrated through interactive sessions, where users can ask questions and receive responses from both the basic completion model and the custom query system. This allows for a comparison of the effectiveness and accuracy of the custom chatbot.

## Additional Features
The chatbot project includes additional features such as dynamic prompting, allowing users to ask multiple questions in succession and receive relevant responses based on context.

## Instructions
To run the code and interact with the chatbot, follow the instructions provided in the respective code cells. Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly before executing the code.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different queries to experience the capabilities of the custom chatbot firsthand.
